# TypeScript Concepts Project

This project demonstrates advanced TypeScript concepts including Enums, Classes, Generics, Promises, Error Handling, and more. It also integrates ESLint for code quality and Jest for testing. The project fulfills several stretch challenges such as exception handling, linting, and unit testing.

---

## Features

- Strongly typed variables, functions, and classes
- Use of Enums to manage roles and statuses
- Generics with arrays and tuples
- Async/Await with Promises and error handling
- Custom Error throwing and handling demonstration
- ESLint configured for TypeScript linting and code consistency
- Jest setup for unit testing TypeScript code
- Sample test cases covering core functionality

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14+ recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Git (for version control)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/typescript-concepts.git
   cd typescript-concepts

2. Install dependencies:
    npm install

---

## Running the Project

1. Compile TypeScript code:
    npm run build
2. Run the compiled JavaScript:
    node dist/index.js

## Running Tests
- Run Jest tests:
    npm test

## Linting
1. Check for lint errors:
    npm run lint

2. Fix lint errors automatically:
    npm run lint:fix

## Project Structure
- src/ - Source TypeScript files
- dist/ - Compiled JavaScript files (auto-generated)
- tests/ - Jest test files
- .eslintrc.json - ESLint configuration
- jest.config.js - Jest configuration
- tsconfig.json - TypeScript compiler options

## Challenges Completed
